# Instrument Identification API

This project provides a FastAPI-based backend to identify musical instruments from audio files using a trained neural network model.

## Features

- Upload an audio file (.mp3, .wav) to predict the instrument played.
- Uses TensorFlow and Librosa for audio feature extraction and prediction.
- Deployed via Docker and Restack Cloud.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sathishvudugundla/instrument-api.git
   cd instrument-api
   ```
